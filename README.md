# Agent Testing

A simple script for testing an AI agent utilizing the Gemini Flash api. This one is informing and knowledgeable about Climate Change. This agent will eventually hopefully resist uneducated opinion about the topic and instead keep on with current global scientific information on the topic.

## Goal

The goal is to create an interactive chat with an AI agent that is knowledgable in the facts of climate change devoid of political or biased opinion.
